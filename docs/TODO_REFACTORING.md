# Refactoring TODO

Tasks for restructuring the codebase now that 3 people are working on it.

---

## Priority: HIGH

### 1. Rename `KurciZaDrzanje/` to `Holds/`
- Rename `scenes/environment/KurciZaDrzanje/` to `scenes/environment/Holds/`
- Update all references in Level .tscn files
- Update `start_screen.gd` if applicable

### 2. Consolidate 3 Hold scenes into 1
- HoldEasy, HoldMedium, HoldHard are identical except `hold_difficulty` and color
- `hold.gd` already has the `@export var hold_difficulty` enum
- Replace with single `Hold.tscn`, set difficulty per instance in each level
- Color can be set programmatically in `_ready()` based on difficulty

### 3. Move `scenes/environment/Levels/` to `scenes/levels/`
- Levels are top-level game content, not sub-environment
- Update `start_screen.gd` level paths

### 4. Fix case mismatch in `start_screen.gd`
- References `res://scenes/environment/levels/` (lowercase L)
- Actual folder is `Levels/` (uppercase L)
- Will break on Linux (case-sensitive filesystem)

### 5. Change player input system
- Current: keyboard numbers 1-4 for limb selection
- Needs rework — discuss new input scheme with team
- Update `InputManager`, `player.gd`, and controls UI

---

## Priority: MEDIUM

### 6. Rename `claude.md/` to `docs/`
- `claude.md` is misleading — it's project documentation, not Claude-specific
- Move all technical docs there
- Update references in README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, CLAUDE_CODE_INSTRUCTIONS.md

### 7. Add `*.uid` to `.gitignore`
- 9 `.gd.uid` files cluttering the scripts folder
- Machine-generated by Godot, should not be tracked

### 8. Clean up unused files
- Delete `prototype.tscn` (leftover, unused)
- Delete `resources/PhysicsMaterials/` (empty folder)

---

## Priority: LOW

### 9. Update all documentation to reflect new structure
- ARCHITECTURE.md — file paths and diagrams
- PROJECT_HANDOFF.md — project structure section
- README.md — project structure section
- NEXT_STEPS.md — file references

---

## Notes
- Do NOT execute any of these yet — discuss with team first
- Each refactoring item should be its own commit
- Test the game after each rename to catch broken references
- Coordinate with Antonio and Lujo so nobody's branch conflicts
