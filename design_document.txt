Boulder QTE - Game Design Document (Prototype)
1. Overview

Title: Boulder QTE
Genre: 2D physics-based puzzle / climbing simulator
Engine: Godot 4.x
Perspective: Side-view (2D)
Platform: PC (Windows/Linux/macOS)
Goal: Create a small playable prototype demonstrating fun limb-based climbing mechanics using ragdoll physics and stamina management.

2. Core Concept

The player controls a floppy, physics-driven climber who must reach the top of a bouldering wall by manipulating individual limbs. Each limb can grip climbing holds when positioned correctly, but holding on drains stamina. When stamina runs out, the climber falls.

3. Game Pillars
•	Tactile Physics – Ragdoll limbs with satisfying motion and tension.
•	Precision and Chaos – Funny but skillful control over limbs.
•	Puzzle Climbing – Finding the right sequence of holds to reach the top.
•	Resource Management – Stamina creates risk/reward decisions.
4. Gameplay Loop

Start: Player spawns at the bottom of a bouldering wall.

Loop:
1. Select a limb (hand or foot).
2. Move it toward a hold (mouse or controller).
3. Latch to hold (press button).
4. Use other limbs to shift weight and climb upward.
5. Monitor stamina; rest or risk falling.
6. Reach the top trigger → win the level.

Fail Condition: Stamina reaches zero and all limbs detach → player falls → restart.

5. Controls
Action	Input
Select limb	Click limb or press 1–4
Move limb target	Move mouse / Arrow keys
Latch / Detach	Space (latch) / X (detach)
Restart level	R
Pause	Esc
6. Core Mechanics

Limb control, latching, stamina drain, detaching, physics-based movement, win condition via top trigger.

7. Game Structure

Each level is a 2D climbing wall with holds, top trigger, and player. Prototype includes one simple wall.

8. Art Direction

Minimal 2D art style with clear limb and hold readability. Use simple shapes for clarity.

9. Audio Design

Placeholder SFX: latch (click), detach (pop), fall (thud), win (chime).

10. Technical Implementation

Scenes: Player.tscn, Limb.tscn, Hold.tscn, Level1.tscn, StaminaBar.tscn.
Use RigidBody2D + PinJoint2D for ragdoll physics.

11. UI & Feedback

Stamina bar, active limb highlight, win message, restart prompt.

12. Prototype Goals

MVP includes working limbs, latch/detach, stamina system, win/fail conditions, and one level.
